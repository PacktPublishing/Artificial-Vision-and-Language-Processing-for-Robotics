       "['At long last, the Giants’ season is over.\\n\\nBut not before choking up one more fourth-quarter lead in crushing fashion.\\n\\nThe Giants took a seven-point lead with 2:35 left in the game, only to watch the playoff-bound Cowboys — who were locked into the fourth seed and had nothing to play for — steal it from them, ending a miserable year in fitting fashion with a 36-35 loss Sunday at MetLife Stadium.\\n\\nFacing a fourth-and-15 from the Giants’ 32-yard line, Dak Prescott evaded pressure and let off a prayer to Cole Beasley, who hauled in the catch and got a knee down before falling out of the back of the end zone. The play initially was ruled incomplete, but upon further review, it was deemed a touchdown with 1:12 left in the game.\\n\\nThe Cowboys then went for two, and Prescott hit Michael Gallup for the 36-35 lead.\\n\\nThe Giants got the ball at their own 48-yard line with two timeouts and 1:05 on the clock, but Eli Manning threw four straight incompletions to end any hope of a final comeback.\\n\\nThe Giants got one key defensive stop late, but it wasn’t enough. On the Cowboys’ first play after the Giants took a 32-28 lead on Saquon Barkley’s 2-yard touchdown with 3:21 to go, Kerry Wynn came from behind to force an Amari Cooper fumble and B.J. Goodson recovered it at the Dallas 18-yard line. It led to Aldrick Rosas padding the lead with a 38-yard field goal to make it 35-28 with 2:35 left, leaving too much time for Prescott to win it.\\n\\nThe Giants went home with a 5-11 record while the Cowboys, the NFC East champs, headed to the playoffs with plenty of momentum.\\nWayne Gallman’s first career rushing touchdown, a 2-yard scamper, gave the Giants their first lead of the day, 25-21, with 10:38 left in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nBut the Giants defense couldn’t back it up with a stop. They got the Cowboys into a third-and-10, only to allow Prescott to scramble and find Allen Hurns deep for a 49-yard gain to the 2-yard line. It set up a 1-yard touchdown from Rod Smith for the 28-25 lead with 9:11 to go.\\n\\nThe Cowboys had taken a 21-10 lead with five minutes left in the third quarter when Prescott found tight end Blake Jarwin for their third touchdown of the day, a 39-yard strike. Jarwin got through at least three defenders on his way to the end zone, including a non-tackle from safety Curtis Riley, who appeared to let up on a chance to make contact.\\n\\nA 68-yard run from Barkley — which made him the third rookie running back to reach 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Eric Dickerson and Edgerrin James — helped set up a 6-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Evan Engram. The duo connected again for the two-point conversion, cutting the deficit to 21-18 with 1:53 left in the third.\\n\\nManning had turned the ball over twice on the Giants’ first two drives of the game. He was intercepted by Chidobe Awuzie in the corner of the end zone, then strip-sacked by DeMarcus Lawrence as the ball ended up in the hands of Antwaun Woods.\\n\\nThe Cowboys failed to turn either turnover into points, though, as Brett Maher pushed a 34-yard field goal wide right after the fumble.\\n\\nSoon, though, the Cowboys got the Prescott-Jarwin connection warmed up. On a third-and-12 from the Giants’ 13-yard line, Prescott found Jarwin wide open in the end zone for a touchdown and 7-0 lead with 8:11 left in the second quarter.\\n\\nAfter another Giants three-and-out, the Cowboys faced a third-and-9 when Prescott hit Jarwin again for a 19-yard touchdown and the 14-0 lead with 1:50 to go.\\n\\nBefore halftime, the Giants got on the scoreboard as Manning led a 10-play, 73-yard drive in 1:35. Cody Latimer ended it with a clutch one-handed grab, with a defensive back draped on him, for a 21-yard touchdown.\\n\\nThe Giants scored on their opening drive of the third quarter on a 48-yard field goal from Aldrick Rosas to cut the deficit to 14-10.',\n",
       " 'This is where we live. In space. On a marble fortified against bottomless blackness by a shell of air and color, fragile and miraculous as a soap bubble.\\n\\nIn 1968, we Earthlings knew that already, sort of. But that abstract notion became visceral on Christmas Eve of that year. While scouting landing spots on the moon, the astronauts of Apollo 8 — Frank Borman, William A. Anders and James A. Lovell, Jr. — spied the shiny blue Earth rising over the ash-colored lunar mountains like a cosmic smiley face. That image, transmitted from space, went on to capture the imagination of the world: Earthrise.\\n\\nMajor Anders had the job of photographing the lunar landscape. When Earth rose, a robot would have kept on clicking off pictures of the craters. Indeed the astronauts briefly joked about whether they should break off and aim their cameras up. “Hey don’t take that, it’s not scheduled,” Commander Borman said. Then, like good humans, they grabbed cameras and clicked away.\\n\\n“Earthrise” did not start environmentalism, but it became the movement’s icon, a gift of perspective at the end of a long, dark year. If you were young, 1968 was the best of times and the worst of times. The Beatles were still together, and “Star Trek” was on TV. You could get high and watch “2001: A Space Odyssey” at the movies. These cultural facets were products of a decade when technological optimism had reigned: you could wage war against communists in Southeast Asia and against poverty and discrimination at home, and conquer space on the side.\\n\\nBut by the end of the decade, pessimism was ascendant. There was no peace or end in sight in Vietnam, nor on the streets at home, roiling with protests, assassinations and riots. In space, the United States trailed the Soviet Union in a peaceful but symbolic technological competition.\\n\\nThe launch of Sputnik, the first Earth-orbiting satellite, startled the world in 1957, and America had been struggling to catch up ever since. President John F. Kennedy committed the United States to landing on the moon before the end of the 1960s, but in January of 1967 a fire in an Apollo capsule killed three astronauts, delaying the project and threatening the deadline.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Soviets had begun sending uncrewed spaceships around the moon. In April of 1968, intelligence agencies warned that the enemy was gearing up to try to send a man around the moon as early as that autumn.\\n\\nBut by the end of 1968, the United States had pulled even and taken the lead in the race to land humans on the moon. That goal was achieved by Apollo 11 on July 20 of the following year — an event that will be widely celebrated on its 50th anniversary in 2019. But a proper observance begins with Apollo 8’s Christmas Eve loop around the moon: the first indication that the Americans might get there first.\\n\\n(This event, too, is being widely celebrated, in books such as Robert Kurson’s “Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man’s First Journey to the Moon,” and the Nova documentary “Apollo’s Daring Mission,” which airs Dec. 26 on PBS.)\\n\\nApollo 8’s original mission was to carry a crew of three around Earth, in a command module that had been redesigned and rebuilt since one of its predecessors burned up on the launchpad in 1967. The mission, slotted for December, would mark the first crewed flight of the mighty Saturn 5 rocket.\\n\\nMajor Anders on Apollo 8.CreditNASA/Johnson Space Center\\nIn those days, NASA’s leaders were still willing to gamble — and so, in August, the plan changed. Historians disagree whether the agency truly feared being beaten to the moon that year or was just keen to get back on schedule. In either case, Commander Borman was called into a closed-door meeting: Would he like to go around the moon in December? It was an offer no astronaut could refuse, never mind that no one had flown on a Saturn 5 yet.\\n\\nWithin weeks the prospective mission had morphed further, from simply looping around the moon to braking and completing an orbit around it. This was a far riskier venture: if the command module rocket failed to fire and break them out of orbit, the astronauts would never come home.\\n\\nIn September, while NASA pondered the mission, the Soviets kept busy, launching a rocket, Zond 5, around the moon and safely returning its crew of worms and tortoises. The Apollo 8 flight was not approved until October, after a crewed flight of Apollo 7 had tested the newly rebuilt command module. On Nov. 11, NASA publicly announced that it would be shooting for the moon the following month.\\n\\nBy then, Zond 6 was on its way — uncrewed, but who knew what might be next. “The September Zond flight scared NASA that the Russians might one-up them one more time by doing it again just before Apollo 8, this time with a cosmonaut aboard,” Roger Launius, NASA’s former chief historian, said recently in an email. (Zond 6 crashed on returning to Earth.)\\n\\nThe Earthrise image beamed from Apollo 8, 176,000 miles away, to the Mission Operations Control Room in Houston.CreditNASA/Johnson Space Center\\nApollo 8 blasted off on Dec. 21. Things did not go smoothly at first. On the way to the moon, Commander Borman became terribly sick, forcing his crewmates to dodge specks of vomit and other bodily excretions, according to Mr. Kurson’s book. They chose not to tell Mission Control about it until he had improved, fearing that the mission would be aborted. All of Earth held its breath when the spacecraft went out of view around the moon, entering radio silence, for the engine burn that would put it into lunar orbit.\\n\\nSeventeen hours later, on Christmas Eve, what NASA has described as the biggest broadcast audience in history was listening when the opening lines of Genesis came crackling down from the heavens.\\n\\n“In the beginning, God created the heaven and the Earth,” Major Anders began.\\n\\n“And God saw that it was good,” Commander Borman said.\\n\\nI had tears in my eyes when I heard that. At Mission Control, the rocket engineers all began to cry, according to Mr. Kurson’s book. Like I said, it had been a long year.\\n\\nIt would take a little while longer for the world to realize that Apollo 8’s greatest legacy would be a single photograph of home. The residents of the only known inhabited planet in the universe would “know the place for the first time” (to borrow from T.S. Eliot). Sent to examine the Moon, Major Anders later said, humans instead discovered Earth.\\n\\nA holiday present for the ages. Alas, it didn’t come with an instruction manual; we’re still working on that.',\n",
       " 'Last spring, soon after Facebook acknowledged that the data of tens of millions of its users had improperly been obtained by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, a top enforcement official at the Federal Trade Commission drafted a memo about the prospect of disciplining the social network.\\n\\nLawmakers, consumer advocates and even former commission officials were clamoring for tough action against Facebook, arguing that it had violated an earlier F.T.C. consent decree barring it from misleading users about their how their information was shared.\\n\\nBut the enforcement official, James A. Kohm, took a different view. In a previously undisclosed memo in March, Mr. Kohm — echoing Facebook’s own argument — cautioned that Facebook was not responsible for the consulting firm’s reported abuses. The social network seemed to have taken reasonable steps to address the problem, he wrote, according to someone who read the memo, and most likely had not broken its promises to the F.T.C.\\n\\nThe Cambridge Analytica data leak set off a reckoning for Facebook and a far-reaching debate about the tech industry, which has collected more information about more people than almost any other in history. At the same time, the F.T.C., which is investigating Facebook, is under growing attack for what critics say is a systemic failure to police Silicon Valley’s giants and their enormous appetite for personal data.\\n\\nAlmost alone among industrialized nations, the United States has no basic consumer privacy law. The F.T.C. serves as the country’s de facto privacy regulator, relying on more limited rules against deceptive trade practices to investigate Google, Twitter and other tech firms accused of misleading people about how their information is used.\\n\\nBut many in Washington view the agency as a watchdog that too rarely bites. In more than 40 interviews, former and current F.T.C. officials, lawmakers, Capitol Hill staff members, and consumer advocates said that as evidence of abuses has piled up against tech companies, the F.T.C. has been too cautious. Now, as the Trump administration and Congress debate whether to expand the agency and its authority over privacy violations, the Facebook inquiry looms as a referendum on the F.T.C.’s future.\\n\\n“They have been asleep at the switch,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the subcommittee charged with overseeing the agency. “It’s a lack of will even more than paucity of resources.”\\n\\nEven if the agency does not penalize Facebook over the Cambridge incident — and some former F.T.C. officials disagree with Mr. Kohm’s reasoning — the commission could punish the company for other offenses. Former officials say they’ve been told that its inquiry has expanded to include recent security and privacy breaches as well as Facebook’s secretive data-sharing deals with Amazon, Netflix and other companies. Facebook declined to comment on the inquiry.\\n\\nThe agency — overseen by five commissioners, three of them typically from the president’s party — is habitually tight-lipped. Joseph J. Simons, the chairman, declined to comment on the Kohm memo.\\n\\n“If the F.T.C. had reached a conclusion that there was no case, we would have announced it,” Mr. Simons said in a statement. “Our investigation continues and when it is finished, you can be sure that the result of that investigation will be made public.”\\n\\nThe agency’s defenders said it had taken significant action against tech companies in recent years. Consumer advocacy groups, they said, sometimes want the F.T.C. to take on cases that its relatively narrow powers will not permit.\\n\\n“The act creating the F.T.C. was not designed with privacy in mind,” said Jessica L. Rich, a consumer protection expert who formerly led the F.T.C.’s consumer bureau. “That they’ve been able to bring hundreds of privacy and data security cases is actually quite a feat, not only given the limitations on their authority but the challenges companies have mounted, especially recently.”\\n\\nA Cautionary Tale\\nAs the federal government’s main consumer protection and antitrust authority, the F.T.C. has pursued carmakers, drug companies, illegal robo-callers and bloggers who fail to disclose corporate sponsors.\\n\\nBut it is hampered by its relatively small size — about 1,100 employees, roughly a quarter the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission — and broad mandate. Guarding consumer privacy online, just one part of its mission, can raise complex technical issues. The agency’s enforcement arm, led by Mr. Kohm, doesn’t have its own tech experts, instead borrowing them from other agency units. The job of chief technologist, an adviser to the F.T.C. chairman, has been vacant since April. And its lawyers are outnumbered by the armies of attorneys employed by tech giants.\\n\\n“They have considerably less staff than they had in the 1980s, and more responsibility,” said Justin Brookman, a former F.T.C. official under the Obama administration who now works at the Consumers Union.\\n\\nF.T.C. officials said privacy and data security cases had gotten more attention than any others over the last decade.\\n\\nStill, all five commissioners agreed at the November Senate hearing that the agency needed more money and greater regulatory authority to keep up with big tech.\\n\\nCritics said a greater problem was cultural. The F.T.C. is haunted, for example, by a clash with Congress in the 1980s over an attempt by the agency to ban television ads for junk food directed at children, known as “KidVid.” Lawmakers pulled funding and severely weakened the F.T.C.’s power to issue new regulations.\\n\\nEven today, “in just about every meeting I have at the F.T.C., staff mention KidVid,” said Josh Golin, the executive director of Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood, which has filed complaints against YouTube and Facebook.\\n\\nFears that Congress could again cripple the F.T.C. have made some career lawyers reluctant to take on politically sensitive cases, according to current and former employees, speaking about their experiences during the Trump and Obama administrations.\\n\\n“They think of themselves as deal-makers, not cops,” said Matt Stoller, policy director at the Open Markets Institute, who has called for big tech platforms to be broken up and regulated. “They have an institutional culture of deference.”\\n\\nThat has hobbled the agency’s approach to tech giants, leading to inadequate responses to privacy violations or efforts to squeeze out emerging competitors, according to Gene Kimmelman, a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department and president of the consumer group Public Knowledge. The F.T.C. needs legislation to allow it to set new rules for the era of big tech, he argued.\\n\\nIn 2013, for example, F.T.C. commissioners overruled a staff recommendation to sue Google for abusing its dominance in search to harm rivals. Three years later, when Google began merging data collected by several of its services, including Gmail and the ad technology platform DoubleClick, consumer groups filed a complaint with the F.T.C. calling the practice “highly deceptive.” The agency took no public action.\\n\\nNor did the F.T.C. penalize Facebook after it began acquiring phone numbers and other data from users of its WhatsApp subsidiary, breaking promises it had made when it acquired the messaging service. By contrast, the European Union’s antitrust chief fined Facebook $122 million last year for making misleading statements about the WhatsApp acquisition.\\n\\n(Facebook said it notified users of the change with new terms of service and had allowed them to opt out of the practice.)\\n\\nThe F.T.C. has defended its record on privacy, pointing for instance to a $22.5 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for bypassing privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser in violation of a consent agreement. The fine was the largest civil penalty in the agency’s history.\\n\\nFormer officials say the agency struggles to enforce privacy within its traditional definition of deceptive or abusive business practices.\\n\\nAshkan Soltani, who was the F.T.C.’s chief technologist from 2014 to 2015, said he raised concerns about a location-tracking company, Nomi Technologies, that collected data on people without their explicit consent. He recalled resistance from Republican commissioners and from some staff members who didn’t see a clear consumer harm, since Nomi’s data could not identify specific individuals.\\n\\nMr. Soltani argued that the F.T.C. needed to get ahead of a technology that would soon become highly intrusive. (He eventually persuaded the agency to investigate, and in 2015 the F.T.C. approved a settlement with Nomi.)\\n\\nToday, dozens of companies gather, use or sell location information so precise that it can pinpoint a phone within a few yards. The data is so detailed that it can often be linked to a specific person — and frequently harvested without clear consent.\\n\\nProving Harm\\nPresident Trump’s arrival in Washington kicked off a period of uncertainty at the F.T.C. For 16 months, three of five seats remained vacant on the commission, which was initially led by an acting chairwoman, Maureen K. Ohlhausen, an advocate of “regulatory humility.”\\n\\nMs. Ohlhausen’s staff told enforcement officials to slow down on cases, so the White House would not view her as anti-business, according to a former senior official. That official and others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe conversations that were private or involved nonpublic F.T.C. investigations.\\n\\nIn an interview, Ms. Ohlhausen denied ordering a slowdown and cited privacy actions she had brought against PayPal and Lenovo. But she acknowledged having argued against going after what she regarded as small cases, like Nomi.\\n\\nWith limited resources, she said, the F.T.C. should “pursue cases where the evidence of actual or likely consumer harms is strongest.”\\n\\nBut that standard is difficult to apply against companies like Facebook and Google, whose services are free, and where it is challenging to prove that privacy lapses cause direct financial or emotional harm.\\n\\nTwo former staffers said Mr. Kohm, who has led the enforcement division for more than a decade, had expressed skepticism about proving harm in cases against tech companies.\\n\\nIn recent months, F.T.C. employees meeting with Mr. Kohm asked how he viewed news reports that big tech firms had tracked users’ locations without clearly disclosing the practice. Mr. Kohm, whose division prosecutes boiler rooms, advertising scams, and other financial fraud schemes, responded that the tech companies were legitimate businesses offering free services, and it was unclear how they had harmed consumers, recalled one person in the meeting.\\n\\nMr. Kohm declined to comment for this article. Cathy MacFarlane, an F.T.C. spokeswoman, denied in a statement that he placed a lower priority on privacy cases, saying Mr. Kohm “has dedicated his career to enforcing the orders the commission obtains, not setting his own agenda.”']"
